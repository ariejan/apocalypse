# Apocalypse

Documentation and the installation guide can be found in the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/ariejan/apocalypse/wiki)

## Summary

No, not that. This Apocalypse is an easy to use server monitoring system. It requires no specific installed software on the remote server (other than what's installed by the OS by default, like Bash and wget). It does no active polling of servers, so the added load of monitoring to your server is kept a minimum.
